As mentioned, I maid a sort of clone of the initial site for The Senior Survey, 2024. I gave it a touch of mine, somewhat funky theme. I used lots of resources, for example looked up on google for libraries, then went for Chart.js for implementing the interactive statistical charts. This week was very hectic for me with many quizzes and projects to do. This was the reason I only got around 2 days to work on my site. I did what I could, but couldn't make the site responsive in this timeframe. I am going to make it responsive after I complete the assignment submission now i.e. 6th April, 2025 ; 11:30pm.
